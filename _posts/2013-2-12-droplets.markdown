####Droplets is an installation where one can affect a simulated aquatic medium provoking waves on its surface.<br/><br/>

The installation’s motif orbits around the concept of the aquatic medium, trying to establish an analogy where the installation’s physical and virtual mediums are correlated. It materializes as the motivation of experimentation not only in the work’s creation but also on behalf of the participants. In this analogy the physical medium, apart from sharing properties with the simulated environment, also adds new kinetic and sonic nuances.
