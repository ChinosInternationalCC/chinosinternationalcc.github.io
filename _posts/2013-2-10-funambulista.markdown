Funambulista is a playful installation but has the intention to question the daily nature of our lives in western world society, and to raise awareness of the number of commercial and political intrusions we experience daily in our lives. The piece invites the user to be a tight rope walker traveling unstably over the world. A bar is placed above a Google Earth projection on the floor. The user walks on the bar controlling the map with her movements. If she falls down, the map is zoomed in to the coordinates where she is standing and receives audiovisual representations of legal terms and conditions.<br/><br/>
