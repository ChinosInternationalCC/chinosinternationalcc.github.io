inSensu is an interactive audiovisual installation that reflects on the perception, based on the concept of synesthesia. From this concept, the project was created as a space for reflection on the limitations of human perception. Thus, the appearance of a series of sound stimuli, manipulated by the user, you get a specific visual response reflected through texture and color. In this way, both stimuli, sound and visual, are closely linked, momentarily increasing perceptual experience.<br/><br/>
