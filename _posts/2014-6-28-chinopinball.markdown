####ChinoPinball a video mapping pinball game for everywhere.<br/><br/>

ChinoPinball itâ€™s a video-mapping pinball game that uses 3d structures as a projection support. Compared to other video-mapping games, this project stands out with the possibility of making the projection on 3d spaces and not only the usual 2D facades.

ChinoPinball was created as an opensource tool game that can be configured and adapted for anyone. This game is designed to be projected in public spaces like streets, squares and buildings or just on a small table with some 3D objects. Ideally you could adapt this game to any context scenario or media content. This can be done with the 3d editor and configuration files.

The game interface is basically composed by 3 inputs (sensors): the start game, the right and the left lever.

The game rules consist of obtaining as much points as possible by reaching all the different objects and missions available.
